# Food Access Program Proposal Analysis

## Problem Statement

A national Medicare Advantage Plan is considering deploying a program to address food access challenges among its members and is seeking advice on the following questions: 

1) Where should the program be deployed?
2) How many people will be included? How many might be successfully engaged?
3) Which subgroup of the population might benefit the most from the program?
4) What is the projected impact of this program?

## Data Sources 
To answer these questions, I used census tract-level data from the CDC and the USDA's Food Environment Atlas. Below is a description of each source: 

_500 Cities: Census Tract-level Data_

This dataset contains information for census tracts from 500 US cities about their populations, the prevalences of various health conditions (high cholesterol, arthritis, cancer, etc.), the prevalences of certain health behaviors (sleeping under 7 hours a night, binge drinking, smoking, etc.), and the rates of healthcare utilization (dentist visits, health insurance, Pap tests, etc.)

_USDA Food Environment Atlas_

This dataset was split into 4 CSV files
