# Food Access Program Proposal Analysis

## Problem Statement

A national Medicare Advantage Plan is considering deploying a program to address food access challenges among its members and is seeking advice on the following questions: 

1) Where should the program be deployed?
2) How many people will be included? How many might be successfully engaged?
3) Which subgroup of the population might benefit the most from the program?
4) What is the projected impact of this program?

## Data Sources 
To answer these questions, I used census tract-level data from the CDC and the USDA's Food Environment Atlas. Below is a description of each source:
